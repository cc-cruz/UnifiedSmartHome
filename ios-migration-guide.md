# iOS Project Migration Guide: DEPRECATED

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE

**This migration guide has been superseded by a comprehensive codebase analysis.**

**New Document**: See `submission-bottleneck.md` for the current state assessment and actionable recommendations.

## Key Finding

After thorough analysis of the codebase, the proposed Swift Package → Xcode App project migration is **unnecessary and counterproductive**:

- ✅ **Current architecture is already App Store ready**
- ✅ **Modern Swift Package structure is preferred by Apple**  
- ❌ **Migration poses significant risk with minimal benefit**
- ❌ **Would delay critical backend IAP implementation**

## Recommendation

**Skip this migration entirely.** The current Swift Package + iOS app structure is modern, functional, and ready for App Store submission.

Focus development effort on the actual submission blocker: **P1 backend IAP implementation**.
