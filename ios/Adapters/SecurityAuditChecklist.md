- [x] Token refresh mechanism works correctly
- [x] Proper error handling for authentication failures
- [x] User permissions are verified before lock operations
- [x] Token expiration is properly handled
- [x] Credentials are securely stored in the keychain
- [x] Access control for keychain items is properly configured

## 2. Network Security

- [x] All API communications use HTTPS
- [x] Certificate pinning is implemented correctly
- [x] Invalid certificates are rejected
- [x] Timeout configurations are appropriate
- [x] Rate limiting is implemented and working
- [x] Retry logic includes exponential backoff
- [x] Network errors are properly handled and logged
- [x] Request headers do not contain sensitive information

## 3. Data Protection

- [x] Sensitive data is not logged or is redacted in logs
- [x] No sensitive information in error messages
- [x] User credentials are not stored in plaintext
- [x] Lock IDs and other identifiers are validated
- [x] Input validation is implemented for all parameters
- [x] Proper sanitization of user input

## 4. Error Handling & Logging

- [x] Comprehensive error types for different failure scenarios
- [x] Errors do not reveal sensitive implementation details
- [x] Audit logging captures all security-relevant events
- [x] User actions are properly logged with appropriate detail
- [x] Failed operations are logged with sanitized error information
- [x] Log levels are appropriate (no sensitive data in DEBUG or INFO)
- [x] Logs include sufficient context for forensic analysis
- [x] Error messages are user-friendly without revealing technical details

## 5. Security Features

- [x] State verification after lock operations is implemented
- [x] Jailbreak detection implemented (if applicable)
- [x] Biometric authentication for critical operations (if applicable)
- [x] Lock operations include proper user attribution
- [x] User presence verification for sensitive operations
- [x] Secure default settings
- [x] Proper handling of invalid or malformed responses

## 6. Testing

- [x] Unit tests cover security-critical functionality
- [x] Integration tests verify end-to-end security
- [x] Security-focused tests for authentication and authorization
- [x] Negative testing (invalid inputs, error conditions)
- [x] Performance testing under load
- [x] Tests for retry logic and rate limiting
- [x] Tests for certificate validation
- [x] Tests for proper error handling

## 7. Code Quality

- [x] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [x] No unnecessary force unwrapping of optionals
- [x] Proper memory management (no leaks of sensitive data)
- [x] Clear separation of concerns
- [x] Secure coding practices followed
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and secure
- [x] No debug code in production builds

- [x] Meets platform-specific security requirements
- [x] Follows Yale API security requirements
- [x] Privacy considerations are documented and addressed
- [ ] Adheres to company security policies
- [ ] Data retention policies are implemented and documented

## 10. Incident Response

- [ ] Update mechanism for security patches

## Audit Results

**Date of Audit:** _________________

**Auditor:** _________________

**Overall Assessment:**
- [ ] Passed with no issues
- [x] Passed with minor issues (see notes)
- [ ] Failed - critical issues found (see notes)

**Notes:**

1. ✅ Biometric authentication implemented for unlock operations
2. ✅ Performance testing implemented with load testing utility
3. Company security policies need to be formally addressed.
